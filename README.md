### Getting Started

After cloning/forking the repo, you have to first run
```
pod install
```
to install the dependencies listed in the Podfile.

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. 
If you do not have it installed you can install it with RubyGems or Homebrew.


From there, make sure to open Meditapp.xcworkspace and not Meditapp.xcodeproj.

Then just build and launch Meditapp!
